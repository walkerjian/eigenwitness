# 🧠 EigenWitness

**An Early Warning System for Covert Trauma Signatures**  
_Designed to detect, timestamp, and quantify identity erosion through facial pattern analysis_

---

## 🎯 Purpose

**EigenWitness** is a forensic facial analysis toolkit built to identify significant deviations in facial appearance and expression patterns. It uses **PCA-based eigenface decomposition** to highlight possible markers of:

- Trauma-induced dissociation
- Image manipulation or surgical intervention
- Psychological masking under duress
- Exploitative control structures in media or institutional systems

This is a tool for those who watch closely, act early, and seek accountability when institutions fall silent.

---

## 🛠️ Features

- ✅ PCA decomposition of aligned face images
- ✅ Cosine deviation scoring from a baseline identity
- ✅ MediaPipe-based facial alignment
- ✅ Gradio GUI preview for image folders
- ✅ Colab-compatible for rapid deployment
- 🔜 Expression flattening detection (micro-expression entropy)
- 🔜 Longitudinal change maps + CSV export

---

## 🧪 Example Use Cases

- Compare an artist's facial patterns pre- and post-management change
- Detect flattening of emotion in public figures over time
- Flag coercion or manipulation in rising influencers
- Aid investigative journalists in pattern-based behavioral forensics

## ⚖️ Ethical Framework

This project was envisioned and authored by **Joseph Ian Walker** in 2025 as a tool of protection, not surveillance.

> “This system exists to restore agency to those rendered voiceless. It is diagnostic, not punitive.  
> Its target is the machinery of manipulation, not its victims.”

Misuse for control, commercial profiling, or unauthorized surveillance is explicitly condemned.
